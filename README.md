## Overview
In this tutorial series, we build an "Image Filters App" using the MVVM architecture and Kotlin programming language. The app allows users to apply various image filters to their photos. The tutorial covers key components such as MVVM architecture, View Binding, GPU Image for image processing, Material Design guidelines, and Koin for Dependency Injection.

## Key Components
1. MVVM Architecture
2. View Binding
3. GPU Image
4. Material Design
5. Koin - Dependency Injection
